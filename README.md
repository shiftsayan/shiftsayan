# ðŸ‘‹  Hello there!

My name is Sayan Chaudhry. My pronouns are he/him/his. And my internet presence is @shiftsayan.

This is as good a place as any to answer the question, "What's @shiftsayan?"

1. @shiftsayan started as my Game Center nickname and I wanted something alliterative but not pretentious.
2. Automobile manufacturer Nissan's tagline "Shift The Way You Move" used to be all over [Indian television commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxQ1dtsxFMI) when I came up with this name.
3. Conveniently, @shiftsayan explains how you would type my first name on the keyboard.
4. I operate a fictional tech company called Shift that competes with Apple, Microsoft, Google, and others.
5. If I ever start a venture capital firm, I have a good reason to call it Caps Lock.
